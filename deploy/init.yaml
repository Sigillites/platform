          A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the
          configured issuers.


          All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation.
          A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status
          condition and its `status.failureTime` field.


          A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single
          point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.

                      If set to `Never`, a private key will only be generated if one does not
                      already exist in the target `spec.secretName`. If one does exists but it
                      does not have the correct algorithm or size, a warning will be raised

                      If set to `Always`, a private key matching the specified requirements
                      will be generated whenever a re-issuance occurs.
                      Default is `Never` for backward compatibility.

                  and `renewBefore=10m`, cert-manager will begin to attempt to renew the certificate
                  50 minutes after it was issued (i.e. when there are 10 minutes remaining until
                  the certificate is no longer valid).


                  NOTE: The actual lifetime of the issued certificate is used to determine the
                  renewal time. If an issuer returns a certificate with a different lifetime than
                  the one requested, cert-manager will use the lifetime of the issued certificate.

                  Minimum accepted value is 5 minutes.

                  RenewalTime is the time at which the certificate will be next

                  The current 'revision' of the certificate as issued.


                  When a CertificateRequest resource is created, it will have the
                  `cert-manager.io/certificate-revision` set to one greater than the
                  current value of this field.


                  Upon issuance, this field will be set to the value of the annotation
                  on the CertificateRequest resource used to issue the certificate.


                  Persisting the value on the CertificateRequest resource allows the
                  certificates controller to know whether a request is part of an old
                  issuance or if it is part of the ongoing revision's issuance by
                  checking if the revision value in the annotation is greater than this
                  field.

                                    Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                    differently based on the type of parent resource.


                                    When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                    listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                    select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                    networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                    as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                    and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                    must match both specified values.

                                    When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                                    Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                                    the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                                    Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                    Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                    document how/if Port is interpreted.


                                    For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                    long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                    listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                    namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                    from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                    attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                    the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                    SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the

                                    * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                    are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                                    Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                    If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                                    listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                    namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                          any namespace to the Service.


                                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                          ParentRef of the Route.

                                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                          must match both specified values.

                                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                          interpreted.


                                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted

                                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully

                                          SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                          following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                          both specified values.
                                          * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                          both specified values.


                                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                          interpreted.


                                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                          the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                          Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
